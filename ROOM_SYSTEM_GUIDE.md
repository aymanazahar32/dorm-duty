## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints Used

```javascript
// Create new room
POST /api/rooms
Body: { name: "Room Name", createdBy: "user-id" }
Response: { roomId: "room-123", name: "Room Name" }

// Update user's room
PUT /api/user/:userId/room
Body: { roomId: "room-123" }
Response: { success: true, user: {...} }

// Verify room exists
GET /api/rooms?roomId=room-123
Response: { room: {...} }
```

### Frontend State Management

**AuthContext provides**:
```javascript
{
  user: {
    id: "supabase-uuid",      // From Supabase auth
    roomId: "room-123",       // From backend
    email: "user@email.com",
    name: "User Name"
  },
  updateProfile: (updates) => void  // Update user object
}
```

**RoomSetup uses**:
```javascript
const { user, updateProfile } = useAuth();

// After creating/joining room
updateProfile({ roomId: newRoomId });

// This updates:
// 1. Context state
// 2. localStorage
// 3. Propagates to all components
```

## üí° How It Works

### User ID (Supabase UUID)

**What**: Unique identifier from Supabase authentication
**Format**: `91d2e8f8-8de4-4e8d-aac4-8e98e4613a42`
**Source**: Created when user signs up
**Purpose**: 
- Identifies user in all API calls
- Used as foreign key in database
- Never changes

**Where it's shown**:
- Profile page (main display)
- Room Setup page (small info box)

### Room ID

**What**: Identifier linking users in the same dorm
**Format**: Custom string (e.g., `room-123`, `dorm-301`)
**Source**: 
- Created when user creates a room
- Copied when user joins a room
**Purpose**:
- Groups users in same dorm together
- Filters chores/tasks by room
- Enables room-based features

**Where it's shown**:
- Profile page (main display if exists)
- Room Setup page (after creation/join)
- Can be shared with roommates
