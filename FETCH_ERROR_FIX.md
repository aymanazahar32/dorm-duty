# Failed to Fetch Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
You were getting "failed to fetch" errors when landing on the home page or creating a new room.

## Root Causes
1. **Port Mismatch**: Backend server was running on port 8000, but frontend expected port 3001
2. **Missing API Endpoints**: The backend server was missing critical endpoints:
   - `/api/tasks` (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
   - `/api/leaderboard` (GET)
   - `/api/laundry` (GET, PATCH)

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Port Configuration
Updated `backend-mock/server.js` to use port 3001:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;
```

### 2. Added Missing Endpoints
Added the following endpoints to the mock backend:

**Tasks API:**
- `GET /api/tasks` - Fetch tasks filtered by userId/roomId
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
- `PATCH /api/tasks` - Update a task
- `DELETE /api/tasks` - Delete a task

**Leaderboard API:**
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get leaderboard with aura points and rankings

**Laundry API:**
- `GET /api/laundry` - Get laundry data
- `PATCH /api/laundry` - Update laundry data

### 3. Restarted Backend Server
- Killed the old process running on port 3001
- Started the updated backend server with all endpoints

## Current Status
✅ Backend server running on `http://localhost:3001`
✅ All required API endpoints implemented
✅ Health check passing: `/health` returns 200 OK

## How to Verify

1. **Check Backend Health:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","users":0,"rooms":2}`

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test the App:**
   - Login/signup
   - Navigate to home page (should load without errors)
   - Create a new room (should work without fetch errors)

## Environment Configuration

Ensure your `frontend/.env` has:
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

## Important Notes

- The backend uses **in-memory storage** (data resets on restart)
- For production, replace with a real database
- Backend must be running before starting frontend
- Default test room "room-1" is automatically created

## Next Steps

If you still see errors:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env`
3. Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
4. Check network tab in DevTools to see which API calls are failing
