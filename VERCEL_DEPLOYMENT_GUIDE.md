## 🚀 Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Your Project
1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for your **dorm-duty** project
3. Click on the project to open it

### Step 2: Create New Deployment
Choose one of these methods:

#### Method A: Direct Branch Deployment
1. In your project page, look for the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click the **"⋯"** (three dots) menu or **"Deploy"** button
3. Select **"Deploy Branch"** or **"Redeploy"**
4. Choose **`anan-backend-backup`** from the branch dropdown
5. Click **"Deploy"**

#### Method B: Git Integration (Automatic)
1. Go to your project **Settings**
2. Click **"Git"** in the left sidebar
3. Under **Production Branch**, keep it as `main`
4. Make sure **"Automatically deploy Preview Deployments"** is enabled
5. Vercel should automatically detect your `anan-backend-backup` branch
6. If not, go to **Deployments** tab and manually trigger a deployment

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings (If Needed)
If asked about the build directory:
- **Framework Preset**: `Create React App`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `build`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- **Root Directory**: `frontend`

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment
1. Once deployment starts, you'll see a build log
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Look for **"Deployment Complete"** message
4. You'll get a deployment URL like: `https://dorm-duty-xxxx.vercel.app`

## 🔗 Your Deployment URLs

Based on your Vercel setup:
- **Production**: https://dorm-duty.vercel.app
- **Branch Preview**: https://dorm-duty-git-anan-backend-backup-aymanazahar32s-projects.vercel.app
  *(or similar URL with your branch name)*

## ⚙️ Environment Variables (Already Configured)

Your environment variables are already set in Vercel:
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` 
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

These will be automatically applied to all deployments.

## 📱 Testing on Multiple Devices

Once deployed, you can access the app from any device:

1. **Desktop/Laptop**: Open the deployment URL in any browser
2. **Mobile Phone**: Visit the URL directly or scan QR code if Vercel provides one
3. **Tablet**: Same as above
4. **Share with Team**: Send the deployment URL to teammates

---

## 🔄 Updating the Deployment

When you make changes:
1. Commit and push to `anan-backend-backup` branch
2. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment (if auto-deploy is enabled)
3. Or manually redeploy from the Vercel dashboard

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Make sure environment variables are set correctly

### App Doesn't Load
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase URLs are correct
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL` points to your Vercel domain

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
- Make sure variables are set for **"Production"**, **"Preview"**, and **"Development"**
- Redeploy after changing environment variables
