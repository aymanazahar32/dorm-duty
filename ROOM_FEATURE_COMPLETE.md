## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Routes Added
```javascript

/profile     → Profile page (protected, with navbar)
```

- Added 5th tab: "Profile" with User icon
- Links directly to profile page

### Backend Integration
```javascript
// Create room
POST /api/rooms
{ name: "Room Name", createdBy: "user-id" }

// Update user's room
PUT /api/user/:userId/room
{ roomId: "room-123" }

// Verify room exists
GET /api/rooms?roomId=room-123
```

### State Management
- Uses AuthContext for user data
- Updates roomId in real-time
- Persists to localStorage
- Propagates to all components
